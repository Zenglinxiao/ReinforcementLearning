# Bandits algorithms, Practical session 2
In this second practical, you are asked to put what you just learnt
about bandits to good use. You are provided with the `main.py` file,
a bandits test bed. Use `python main.py -h` to check how to use this file.

I've implemented:
* Epsilon-greedy bandit
* Besa https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01025651v1/document
* UCB https://homes.di.unimi.it/~cesabian/Pubblicazioni/ml-02.pdf
* softmax https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~vkules/bandits.pdf
* Thompson sampling Agent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling
